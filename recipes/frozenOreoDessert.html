    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a recipe that makes a frozen oreo dessert that is quite popular in the southern regions of the United State of America.</p>

    <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 package (14.3-ounce) of Oreo cookies, divided into 12 cookies and the remainder</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 cup of heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>8 ounces of cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 (14-ounce) can of sweetened condensed milk</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove 12 Oreos from the package. Set these aside. These will be crushed for an Oreo topping. Crush the remaining Oreos until they are finely ground.</li>
        <li>Mix half of the crushed Oreo crumbs with the melted butter. Press the Oreo crust mixture into a 9Ã—9-inch square baking pan to form the crust. Place the pan in the refrigerator to set while preparing the filling. Set aside the rest of the Oreo crumbs.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form. Set this aside.</li>
        <li>In another large bowl, cream together the cream cheese and sugar. Then, add the vanilla and mix together.</li>
        <li>Using a spatula, gently fold the heavy whipping cream into the cream cheese mixture.</li>
        <li>Add the sweetened condensed milk and continue mixing gently until fully combined.</li>
        <li>Mix in the remaining Oreo cookie crumbs.</li>
        <li>Spread the mixture evenly over the cookie crust.</li>
        <li>Crush the rest of the cookies and sprinkle them on top of the filling. These Oreos should be crushed up into medium-sized chunks.</li>
        <li>Cover the pan with foil and place it in the freezer until solid. Freeze for at least three to four hours, preferably overnight. Remove the pan from the freezer 15 minutes before serving. This will give the dessert time to soften slightly so that it is easier to cut.</li>
    </ol>
