    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a recipe that will show you how to make chicken parmesan, which utilizes boneless-skinless chicken breast, panko for the breading, fresh mozarella balls for topping, and many other ingredients.</p>
    <p>This recipe belongs to the critically aclaimed chef, Gordon Ramsay, and is subsequently a recipe that I prepared on various occasions during my sophomore year of college.</p>

    <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>6 Boneless Skinless Chicken Thighs</li>
        <li>1 oz Parmesan Cheese Freshly Grated</li>
        <li>1/2 Tbsp Parsley, Finely Chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 Tbsp Fresh Oregano, Finely Chopped</li>
        <li>1 Cup Panko Breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp Paprika</li>
        <li>2 Whole Eggs</li>
        <li>1 Cup All-Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>1 Tsp Kosher Salt</li>
        <li>1/2 Tsp Black Pepper</li>
        <li>Approx. 2 Cups Canola oil for frying</li>
        <li>8 oz Fresh Mozzarella balls</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large cast-iron skillet, fill with oil until the depth is about 1 cm.  Using a thermometer, heat the oil until it reaches 350 F.  If you have a deep fryer (we've cooked this recipe both ways) heat pre-heat your oil to 350 as well.</li>
        <li>While the oil is heating, prepare the breading bowls.  You will need three large shallow bowls for this.  In your first bowl, mix 1 cup all-purpose flour with 1 tsp Salt and 1/2 tsp Pepper. In your second bowl, whisk two eggs.  In your third bowl, mix 1 cup Panko Breadcrumbs, 1 oz grated Parmesan Cheese, 1/2 Tbsp chopped parsley, 1/2 tbsp chopped oregano, and 1/2 tsp paprika.</li>
        <li>Flatten the chicken. To reduce mess and cleanup, place one chicken thigh between two sheets of plastic wrap on top of a cutting board.  Using a mallet, flatten the chicken thighs individually until they are about 1 cm in thickness.</li>
        <li>When the oil has reached temperature, start the breading procedure.  Working in batches, coat the flattened chicken thoroughly in flour, then in the egg, and finally in the panko bread crumbs. Using a pair of tongs, lower the chicken slowly into the oil.  Do not crowd the pan.  We find that a maximum of 3 pieces fit in a 12" cast iron skillet, or 2 pieces into our 3.5L deep fryer basket.  If using a skillet, cook for 4 minutes on one side, then flip and cook for an additional 2 minutes.  If using a deep fryer, cook for 3 minutes, then flip and cook for 1 additional minute.  The chicken should be a nice golden color when done.</li>
        <li>To finish the plate, place slices of fresh mozzarella on top of the chicken and melt using your oven's broiler for 1 minute. Top with some fresh basil and serve!</li>
